# Adding Remote MCP Backends

Remote MCP servers — anything reachable over HTTP or SSE — plug into
mcp-gateway the same way local `stdio` servers do: one entry under `backends:`
in your `gateway.yaml`. No new code, no capability YAML, no proxy glue.

This guide uses [GitMCP](https://gitmcp.io) as a worked example because it is
free, requires no auth, and instantly gives your AI a searchable view of any
public GitHub repository.

## The 30-second recipe

Add this to your `gateway.yaml`:

```yaml
backends:
  gitmcp_docs:
    http_url: "https://gitmcp.io/docs/sse"
    description: "GitMCP — on-demand docs + code search for any GitHub repo"
    timeout: 30s
```

Restart (or hot-reload) the gateway. That's it. Your AI can now call GitMCP's
tools through `gateway_search_tools` / `gateway_invoke`.

## How the gateway picks the transport

The gateway infers transport from the shape of the backend entry:

| Entry field | Transport | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `command:` | stdio | Subprocess you spawn locally |
| `http_url:` ending in `/sse` | SSE | Server-Sent Events handshake |
| `http_url:` with `streamable_http: true` | Streamable HTTP | Direct POST, no SSE |
| `http_url:` (other) | Plain HTTP | Legacy HTTP MCP servers |

See [`src/config/mod.rs`](../src/config/mod.rs) `TransportConfig` for the exact
rules. GitMCP supports SSE, so the `/sse` suffix is the right choice — you get
streaming notifications and long-lived sessions for free.

## Dynamic vs. repo-pinned routes

GitMCP exposes two URL shapes:

1. **Dynamic dispatcher**: `https://gitmcp.io/docs/sse`
   - One backend covers every public GitHub repo.
   - Tools take a repo URL as an argument:
     `fetch_generic_url_content`, `search_generic_code`,
     `search_generic_documentation`.
   - Best when you browse many repos.

2. **Repo-pinned route**: `https://gitmcp.io/{owner}/{repo}/sse`
   - Scoped to one repository.
   - Tools are named after the repo, e.g.
     `fetch_mcp_gateway_documentation`, `search_mcp_gateway_code`.
   - Best when the gateway backs one project and you want clean tool names.

Both variants are just different `http_url` values. You can even define both in
the same config:

```yaml
backends:
  gitmcp_docs:
    http_url: "https://gitmcp.io/docs/sse"
    description: "GitMCP — any GitHub repo (dynamic)"

  gitmcp_self:
    http_url: "https://gitmcp.io/MikkoParkkola/mcp-gateway/sse"
    description: "GitMCP — pinned to mcp-gateway"
```

## Calling the tools through the gateway

Once a backend is registered, the usual Meta-MCP flow applies:

```jsonc
// 1. Find the tool
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "gateway_search_tools",
    "arguments": { "query": "github documentation" }
  }
}

// 2. Invoke it
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "gateway_invoke",
    "arguments": {
      "server": "gitmcp_docs",
      "tool": "fetch_generic_url_content",
      "arguments": {
        "url": "https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/mcp-gateway"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

No token cost for loading GitMCP's schemas into the model: the gateway's
Meta-MCP surface keeps discovery compact and the AI only pays for the tool it
actually calls.

## Authenticated remote backends

For remote servers that need auth, add headers or OAuth:

```yaml
backends:
  my_saas:
    http_url: "https://mcp.example.com/sse"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${MY_SAAS_TOKEN}"

  my_google:
    http_url: "https://mcp.googleapis.com/mcp"
    streamable_http: true
    oauth:
      enabled: true
      scopes:
        - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"
      client_id: "env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
```

See [`examples/gateway-full.yaml`](../examples/gateway-full.yaml) for the full
set of backend fields, including timeouts, idle hibernation, secret injection,
and `passthrough` mode.
